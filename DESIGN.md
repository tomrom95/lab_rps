Use Cases
=======

* A new game is started with two players, their scores are reset to 0.
```java
// In Game class
List<Players> newPlayers = createPlayers(2);
// Assuming Rule rules, WeaponSet weaponset
startGame(rules, weaponset, newPlayers);
```
* A player chooses his RPS "weapon" with which he wants to play for this round.

```java
// In Game class
// Assuming Player player
Weapon w = player.chooseWeapon();

```
* Given two players' choices, one player wins the round, and their scores are updated.

```java
// In Game class
int getWinner(Player p1, Player p2){
    //compare weapons
    //1 - p1 weapon wins, 0 - tie, -1 p2 weapon wins
}

```
* A new choice is added to an existing game and its relationship to all the other choices is updated.
```java
// In Game class
Weapon newChoice = new Weapon(name);
weaponset.addWeapon(newChoice);
// Assume choices it beats is in List<Weapon> winners -> from input file
// Assume choices it loses to is in List<Weapon> losers -> from input file
for(Weapon w: winners){
    rules.addRule(newChoice, w); // Winning choice comes first
}
for(Weapon w: losers){
    rules.addRule(w, newChoice); 
}
```
* A new game is added to the system, with its own relationships for its all its "weapons".
```java
// In RPS class
// Assuming Game g
game.resetGame()
// Assuming Rules rules
game.updateRules(rules)
```
